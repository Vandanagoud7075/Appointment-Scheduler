Alexa: Amazon's Virtual Assistant

Alexa is Amazon's virtual assistant that uses voice recognition technology to interact with users and perform a wide range of tasks.
When a user speaks to an Alexa-enabled device, the device first records the audio and sends it to Amazon's servers. The audio is then analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to understand the user's intent.
Alexa's capabilities can be extended through third-party skills, allowing users to personalize their experience and access a wide range of services and functionalities using natural language voice interactions.


TECH STACK:
AWS lambda: AWS Lambda can be used to build serverless web applications. Lambda functions can be used to build chatbots and voice assistants that interact with users via messaging platforms or voice-enabled devices. Offers automatic scaling and high availability.

•Alexa Skill Kit (ASK):Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) is a collection of APIs and tools provided by Amazon that allows developers to create custom voice-enabled features, known as skills, for Alexa-enabled devices.
